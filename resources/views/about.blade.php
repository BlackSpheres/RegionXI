				    	The <b>Davao Gulf area</b> is <mark>the first region</mark> in the country that is in contact with the Europeans, with such contacts taking place as early as <b>16th century</b>. The <b>Portuguese</b> are the ones who preceded the Spaniards, who are the ones to colonize the region albeit much later, in sighting and visiting the region. In 1512, Francisco Serrano was shipwrecked in the shallow waters and coral reefs of Cape of San Agustín, located in what is now the province of Davao Oriental. In 1538, Francisco de Castro, a Portuguese captain, was driven by strong winds to the southeastern coast of Mindanao. He baptized several chieftains in the area.
				    	<br><br>
						Around January 1546, Francis Xavier, a Jesuit priest, left Malacca and went to Molucca Islands, then called the Spice Islands, where the Portuguese had some settlements, and for a year and a half he preached the Gospel to the inhabitants of Amboyna, Ternate, Baranura, and other lesser islands. It is claimed by some that during this expedition he landed on the island of Mindanao, which is confirmed by some writers of the seventeenth century, and in the Bull of canonization issued in 1623. It is also said that he is the one to have preached the Gospel in Mindanao.

				    	For centuries the tribes lived in relative peace until the Spanish, under the adventurous Spanish businessman Don Jose Oyanguren, arrived in the region in 1847. At that time, the Moro tribal chieftain <b>Datu Bago</b> was in control of the area in what is now Davao City. Don Oyanguren attempted to conquer the area which Datu Bago had ruled; although he failed at first, the Moro chieftain eventually evacuated his people to live in the areas near Mount Apo. This is the time the town of Davao, then called <b>Nueva Vergara</b> by the Spaniards, was established in the year 1848.

				    	After the Spanish–American War in 1898, Spanish rule in the region ended.

						In 1903 until 1914, the region was one of the districts of the former Moro Province in Mindanao.

				    	In 1942, during World War II, as the Japanese occupation of the Philippines began, the region was <b>one of the first</b> among the Philippine regions to be subjected by Japanese occupation.

The Japanese went back to their ships at night to sleep since the Moros struck so much fear into them, even though the Moros were outnumbered by the Japanese. The longest battle of the Allied liberation campaign, <mark>the Battle of Davao</mark>, took place in <b>1945</b>. After the war, the region eventually passed to the American hands again for at least almost one year before the formal Philippine independence in July 4, 1946; most of the Japanese living in the region were now integrated in the Filipino population.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

				    	<blockquote  style="text-align: justify;">
				    	<p>
				    		While the region’s economy is <mark>predominantly agri-based</mark>, it is now developing into a center for agro-industrial business, trade and tourism. Its competitive advantage is in agri-industry as its products, papayas, mangoes, bananas, pineapples, fresh asparagus, flowers, and fish products are exported internationally. The region can be a vital link to markets in other parts of Mindanao, Brunei Darussalam and parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. There is also a<mark> growing call center sector</mark> in the region, mostly centered in Davao City.<br><br>

							There is a gradual shift to industrialization as shown with industry’s <b>growth rate of 8.1%</b> in 1996. Other economic activities are <mark>mining, fishery, forestry and agriculture</mark>. Due to the region's rise as the main commercial and industrial hub of Mindanao, many of its workers are oriented to urban services such as putting small-scale businesses and working in commercial industries in thriving urban areas like Davao, Tagum, and Digos. Both private and foreign investors and businessmen are putting up huge business centers in the region, fueling up its commercial growth rate.<br><br>

							The region is also venturing to online business like <b>outsourcing</b>.

				    	<mark>The Atas</mark> (also Ataas, Itaas) are powerful people of unknown origin who appear to be a <b>mixture of Negritos and Malays</b>. They occupy the hinterlands comprising the headwaters of Davao, Tuganay and Libuganon Rivers. They are very sensitive but can easily be put under control if done with tact. A vindictive type of people, utmost care is exercised in dealing with them. They have a language of their own. Their name means “dwellers in highlands”. Living in frail huts of palm leaves and bark of trees built on top of trees, they depend primarily on hunting for their livelihood. They are believed to be <mark>the most numerous</mark>.<br><br>

				    	<mark>The Bagobos</mark> mostly occupy the lower slopes of Mt. Apo, extending from upper Digos in the south to Talomo and Tugbok in the north and to Baguio in upper Calinan on the northwest slope. They are known as <mark>the most elaborately dressed</mark> of the Davao tribes. In view of their proximity to the Christian settlements since Spanish times, they are the tribe most integrated with Christian society. The influx of newcomers to Davao, starting with the Japanese, has gradually eased this tribe from the excellent lands they had been occupying.<br><br>

				    	<mark>The B’la-ans</mark> are the Malay people occupying mainly the interior region between the Bulatukan River (in Bansalan) and the Sarangani Islands and it’s Bay. Exceedingly timid, they have a peaceful disposition and are <mark>the most industrious</mark> of all the natives. They grow rice on the plains of the interior region they occupy.<br><br>

				    	<mark>The Dulanganes</mark> (Gulanganes, also called Bangai-Bangal by the Moros) are found in the hinterlands of southern Davao and Cotabato. It is not known whether they are pure-blooded or Malay with an infusion of Negrito blood. <mark>They are savage and fierce</mark>, and Moros themselves do not want to meddle with then, calling them <b>a bad race</b>. They are naked except for a small covering made of leaves or bark of trees. They have no houses and Iive in caves or inside tree trunks. Their weapons usually are poisoned arrows.<br><br>

						<mark>The Guiangas</mark> are scattered on the Rancherias of Gumalang, Tamugan, upper Toril and Biao. The tribe’s dialect is totally different from neighboring Bagobo’s. They are also called Guanga or Guianga, which means “forest people.” They are suspected of being fragments of the little-known tribe, who according to location lived in southern Mindanao under the names Manguangas, Mangulangas or Dulanganes. Like Bagobos, they practice human sacrifice.<br><br>

						<mark>The Loacs</mark> belong to the Tagacaolo tribe who dwells in the mountain forest of the San Agustin peninsula. They are <mark>the poor members</mark> of the Tagacaolo tribe who have isolated themselves as a means of protection from being made slaves by the rich and powerful segment of their tribe. <br><br>

						<mark>The Maguindanao</mark> are <b>the Moros of Cotabato</b>, also the Moros who inhabit the Sarangani Islands and parts of Davao Gulf coast. Living mostly along the mouths of rivers, they impeded the Spanish colonizers’ efforts at bringing the other tribes of Davao within the Christian fold.<br><br>

						<mark>The Mandayas</mark> (Mandaya or “people of the upland”, Ilaya) are of Malay stock. They inhabit the slopes of the mountain range that borders the Pacific Ocean, from Mati to Bislig, and the area in upper Tagum and Hijo Rivers, as well as the upper Agusan River Valley. They were famed as a headhunting people, but their early contacts with the Spanish colonizers (since early 1600s) have made them <mark>the first tribe to embrace civilized life</mark>. <br><br>

						<mark>The Manobos</mark> (Manuba or Man-Suba, ‘river people”, also “those who grew up” (of Malay extraction) chiefly occupy the Agusan river valley in Compostela. They inhabit various points from Malalag to Sarangani and between Cuabo and Cape San Agustin. The Manobos are considered <mark>the most aboriginal tribe</mark> of Mindanao. Of Malay stock, the Manobos are slight of built but athletic. They have little liking for work and are warlike and valiant, being usually hunters for slaves. Although wild, they are easy to resettle but difficult to preserve. Their houses are built near the rivers, often on the forks of trees. They change glass-stringed beads, Manobos prefer black rather than the more popular red among the Mandayas. <br><br>

						<mark>The Samales</mark> inhabit the island of Samal in the Davao Gulf. They are mostly Moro-Mandaya mestizos. Originally believed to be the descendants of that emigration (between 1460-1480) led by the Shariff Kabunsuwan from Johore, Malaya, who were dispersed by astorm, they reportedly found their way to different islands south of the Philippines, including Mindanao. Tradition distinctly states that he people who came with Kabungsuwan were Samales. The Samales or Bajaws are the sea nomads of the Malay Archipelago, and their emigrations are frequent. They are not so difficult to resettle, and are in fact well-inclined to the Spaniards whom they helped in ousting the Moro chieftain.<br><br></p></blockquote>
